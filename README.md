# **Hello I am JhaneenðŸ‘‹**

Welcome to my profile! 

Iâ€™m a 3rd-year Business Information Management student focusing on Health Informatics, passionate about pursuing a career in full-stack healthcare IT. Iâ€™m excited to combine my love for coding with improving healthcare through digital solutions. Iâ€™m driven to keep learning and making an impact where technology meets healthcare. Outside of tech, I enjoy hiking and exploring new food spots, always eager to try something new :flight_departure: :world_map:
